# Deliveries Powerpack Theme

Here is an [Alfred Powerpack Theme](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/appearance/) that is inspired by JuneCloud's [Deliveries.app](https://deliveries.app) appearance and color scheme.

[**Download Themes**](https://github.com/chrismessina/alfred-theme-deliveries/releases/latest)

## Suggested configuration

- Disable the Alfred hat logo by checking: `Alfred Preferences › Appearance › Options › Hide hat on Alfred window`

Simplify results by switching the result subtext to "Only for Alternative Actions".
